# babelsentiment

This project is an uncompleted version of a sentiment analysis research project I completed as part of the 2018 UGA Digital Scholar Cohort. 

The project takes three hard-coded inputs (different translations of a short story by Borges) and returns multiple analysis graphs of them. They can be used to track sentiment differences between translations, and I had hoped to observe drastic changes between them due to the time period each translation was created.


#Usage

- Clone repo
- Edit each ".r" file to set graph size

```png("Plots/Simple/Hurley/syuzhet.png", width = 1200,height = 700)```

- Once you run the scripts, it will create unsigned, signed, simple, and NRC emotion plots for each text using each available lexicon.

#Future

This project is unfinished. Future releases will allow users to set their direct inputs, choose which graphs to generate, choose a lexicon, and provide much a much better user experience.
