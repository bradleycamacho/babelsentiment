Very dirty 1.0 version

This will create plots using Sentiment Analysis tools from the Syuzhet package. Necessary packages are not include, install packages mentioned as needed.

Usage:
- Edit each .R file to set graph size: ```png("Plots/Simple/Hurley/syuzhet.png", width = 1200,height = 700)```
- Run code from terminal or program such as R Studio
- The files will generate unsigned, signed, simple, and NRC emotion plots for each text using each available lexicon

Texts and directory structure are included, but documentation within is practically non-existent. Future versions will combine all scripts into one, add modularity, and simplify size input.
